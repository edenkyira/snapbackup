There are two ways to contribute your translation work to the Snap Backup project.

== A) E-Mail ==
Steps:
   # Download the properties file from: [http://www.snapbackup.com/translate/ www.snapbackup.com/translate]
   # Edit the properties file (save with UTF-8 encoding).
   # E-mail the properties file to the Snap Backup Translators Mailing List at: [http://groups.google.com/group/snapbackup-translate groups.google.com/group/snapbackup-translate]

This approach is simple, but there is no practical way to test your properties file before submitting it to the mailing list.

== B) Direct Contribution ==
This approach involves setting up the Snap Backup project on your computer and submitting your properties file directly into the project repository hosted on Google Code.

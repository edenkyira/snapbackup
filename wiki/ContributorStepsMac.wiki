= Snap Backup Contributor Steps for Mac OS X =

Follow these steps on Mac OS X to use Subversion (SVN) to access the Snap Backup source code and submit your changes.

== 1. One-Time Environment and SVN Setup ==
*A) Get Your Password*
   To obtain your password (needed for next step), visit:
      http://code.google.com/hosting/settings

*B) Download Code*
   Run _Terminal_ (it's in `/Applications/Utilities`) and enter the following commands at the Unix shell prompt:
   || `$ mkdir ~/Projects` ||
   || `$ cd ~/Projects` ||
   || `$ svn checkout https://snapbackup.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ snapbackup --username <USERNAME HERE>` ||
   In the above instructions, replace "`<USERNAME HERE>`" with your Google Code username.  If you get an "Error validating server certificate", you can enter "p" to permanently accept the certificate.

*C) Download and Install Xcode (optional)*
   If you plan to create the installer (see step 3B below), you need to get _*Xcode for Mac Development*_ at:
      http://developer.apple.com/tools/download/
   Open the downloaded _*.dmg*_ file and run _*!XcodeTools.mpkg*_ to complete the Xcode installation.  Use the default options.

== 2. Core Contributor Steps ==
*A) Build Current Project and Verify*
   Open _Finder_ --> Go to the folder `~/Projects/snapbackup/src/tools` --> Double-click the file _*build.sh.command*_ --> Go to the folder `~/Projects/snapbackup/build` --> Double-click the file _*snapbackup.jar*_ -->  Verify that the Snap Backup application launches and works properly

*B) Edit Code*
   The project files are under the `~/Projects/snapbackup` folder.  Use your editor or IDE to make changes to the appropriate files.

*C) Build the Project and Verify*
   Repeat step A above.

*D) Check Changes into SVN Repository (Server)*
   || `$ cd ~/Projects/snapbackup` ||
   || `$ svn update` ||
   || `$ svn status` ||
   || `$ svn commit --message "<COMMENT HERE>."` ||
   || `$ svn status` ||
   In the above instructions, replace "`<COMMENT HERE>`" with a short description of the changes you made.

== 3. Mac OS X Installer ==
To wrap the Mac application (`~/Projects/snapbackup/build/Snap Backup.app`) into a native [http://www.centerkey.com/mac/java/ Mac OS X installer], follow these steps:
      # Using _Finder_, navigate to the `~/Projects/snapbackup/src/installer/mac` folder
      # Double-click _*snap-backup.pmdoc*_  (the first time you may have to open from !PackageMaker)
      # Click the _*Build*_ hammer icon
      # Navigate to the `~/Projects/snapbackup/build` folder
      # Deselect the "Hide extension" option
      # Click the _*Save*_ button
      # Quit _!PackageMaker_ and choose _*Don't Save*_ your changes
The new installer will be at: `~/Projects/snapbackup/build/SnapBackupInstaller.mpkg`

= Snap Backup Contributor Steps for Mac OS X =

Follow these steps on Mac OS X to use Subversion (SVN) to access the Snap Backup source code and submit your changes.

== 1. One-Time SVN Setup ==
*A) Download and Install Xcode*
   Get _Xcode for Mac Development_ at:
      http://developer.apple.com/tools/download/
   Open the downloaded _.dmg_ file and run _!XcodeTools.mpkg_ to complete the Xcode installation.  Use the default options.

*B) Download and Install SVN Client*
   To get the installer (binary), follow the _openCollabNet_ link for Mac OS X at:
      http://subversion.tigris.org/getting.html#binary-packages

*C) Get Your Password*
   To obtain your password (needed for next step), visit:
      http://code.google.com/hosting/settings

*D) Download Code*
   Run _Terminal_ (it's in `/Applications/Utilities`) and enter the following commands at the Unix shell prompt:
   || `$ mkdir ~/Projects` ||
   || `$ cd ~/Projects` ||
   || `$ svn checkout https://snapbackup.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ snapbackup --username <USERNAME HERE>` ||
   In the above instructions, replace "`<USERNAME HERE>`" with your Google Code username.  If you get an "Error validating server certificate", you can enter "p" to permanently accept the certificate.

== 2. Core Contributor Steps ==
*A) Build Current Project and Verify*
   Open _Finder_ --> Go to the folder _~/Projects/snapbackup/src/tools/_ --> Double-click the file _build.sh.command_ --> Go to the folder _~/Projects/snapbackup/build/_ --> Double-click the file _snapbackup.jar_ -->  Verify that the Snap Backup application launches and works properly

*B) Edit Code*
   The project files are under the _~/Projects/snapbackup_ folder.  (Note to translators: the language files are at _~/Projects/snapbackup/src/resources/properties_.)  Use your editor to makes changes to the appropriate files.

*C) Build the Project and Verify*
   Repeat step A above.

*D) Check Changes into SVN Repository (Server)*
   || `$ cd ~/Projects/snapbackup` ||
   || `$ svn update` ||
   || `$ svn status` ||
   || `$ svn commit --message "<COMMENT HERE>."` ||
   || `$ svn status` ||
   In the above instructions, replace "`<COMMENT HERE>`" with a short description of the changes you made.

== 3. Create Mac Application with Installer ==
*A) Mac OS X Application (optional)*
   To turn the Executable Java Archive (Jar) file into a proper [http://www.centerkey.com/mac/java/ Mac OS X application], open _Jar Bundler_  (it's in _/Developer/Applications/Utilities_) and follow these steps:
      # For the "Main Class:", use the *Choose...* button and go to and choose "ShowTime.jar"
      # Check the "Use Macintosh Menu Bar" option
      # Use the *Choose Icon* button to choose the "SnapBackup.icns" file (you'll need to navigate to the _Users_ folder to find the _ItsShowtime" folder)
      # Click the *Properties* tab and enter "1.0" into the "Version:" field
      # Also enter "1.0" into the "Get-Info String:" filed
      # Click the *Create Application...* button
      # In the "File:" field, enter "Show Time"
      # Navigate into the "ItsShowtime" folder
      # Use the *New Folder* button to create a folder called "Show Time Mac App"
      # Click the *Create* button
      # Quit _Jar Bundler_

*B) Mac OS X Installer (optional)*
   To wrap the application into a native [http://www.centerkey.com/mac/java/ Mac OS X installer], follow these steps:
      # Using _Finder_, navigate into the _~/Projects/snapbackup/src/installer/mac_ folder
      # Double-click _snap-backup.pmdoc_

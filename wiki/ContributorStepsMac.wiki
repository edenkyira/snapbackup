= Snap Backup Contributor Steps for Mac OS X =

Follow these steps on Mac OS X to use Subversion (SVN) to access the Snap Backup source code and submit your changes.

== One-Time SVN Setup ==
1) Download and Install Xcode
   Get *Xcode for Mac Development* at:
      http://developer.apple.com/tools/download/
   Open the downloaded *.dmg* file and run the *!XcodeTools.mpkg* file to complete the Xcode installation.  Use the default options.

2) Download and Install SVN Client
   To get the installer (binary), follow the *openCollabNet* link for Mac OS X at:
      http://subversion.tigris.org/getting.html#binary-packages

3) Get Your Password
   To obtain your password, visit:
      http://code.google.com/hosting/settings

4) Download Code
   Run *Terminal* (it's in `/Applications/Utilities`) and enter the following commands at the Unix prompt:
   || `$ mk ~/Projects` ||
   || `$ cd ~/Projects` ||
   || `$ svn checkout https://snapbackup.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ snapbackup --username <USERNAME HERE>` ||
In the above instructions, replace "`<USERNAME HERE>`" with your Google Code username.


== Contributor Steps ==
1) Build Current Project and Verify
   In *Finder*, go to the `~/Projects/snapbackup/src/tools/` and double-click the *build.sh.command* file.  Now go to the `~/Projects/snapbackup/build/` folder and double-click *snapbackup.jar*`.  Verify the Snap Backup application is working properly.

2) Edit Code
   The project files are all under the `~/Projects/snapbackup` folder.  Use your editor to makes changes to the appropriate files.  (Note to translators: the language files are at `~/Projects/snapbackup/src/resources/properties`).

3) Build the Project and Verify
   Repeat step #1 above.

4) Check Changes into SVN Repository (Server)
   || `$ cd ~/Projects/snapbackup` ||
   || `$ svn update` ||
   || `$ svn status` ||
   || `$ svn commit --message "<COMMENT HERE>."` ||
   || `$ svn status` ||
In the above instructions, replace "`<COMMENT HERE>`" with a short description of the changes you made.

= Snap Backup Contributor Steps for Mac OS X =

Follow these steps on Mac OS X to use Subversion (SVN) to access the Snap Backup source code and submit your changes.

== One-Time SVN Setup ==
*1) Download and Install Xcode*
   Get _Xcode for Mac Development_ at:
      http://developer.apple.com/tools/download/
   Open the downloaded _.dmg_ file and run _!XcodeTools.mpkg_ to complete the Xcode installation.  Use the default options.

*2) Download and Install SVN Client*
   To get the installer (binary), follow the _openCollabNet_ link for Mac OS X at:
      http://subversion.tigris.org/getting.html#binary-packages

*3) Get Your Password*
   To obtain your password, visit:
      http://code.google.com/hosting/settings

*4) Download Code*
   Run _Terminal_ (it's in `/Applications/Utilities`) and enter the following commands at the Unix prompt:
   || `$ mk ~/Projects` ||
   || `$ cd ~/Projects` ||
   || `$ svn checkout https://snapbackup.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ snapbackup --username <USERNAME HERE>` ||
In the above instructions, replace "`<USERNAME HERE>`" with your Google Code username.


== Contributor Steps ==
*1) Build Current Project and Verify*
   In *Finder*, go to the `~/Projects/snapbackup/src/tools/` and double-click the _build.sh.command_ file.  Now go to the `~/Projects/snapbackup/build/` folder and double-click _snapbackup.jar_.  Verify the Snap Backup application is working properly.

*2) Edit Code*
   The project files are all under the `~/Projects/snapbackup` folder.  Use your editor to makes changes to the appropriate files.  (Note to translators: the language files are at `~/Projects/snapbackup/src/resources/properties`).

*3) Build the Project and Verify*
   Repeat step #1 above.

*4) Check Changes into SVN Repository (Server)*
   || `$ cd ~/Projects/snapbackup` ||
   || `$ svn update` ||
   || `$ svn status` ||
   || `$ svn commit --message "<COMMENT HERE>."` ||
   || `$ svn status` ||
In the above instructions, replace "`<COMMENT HERE>`" with a short description of the changes you made.

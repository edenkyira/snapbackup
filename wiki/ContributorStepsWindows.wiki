Follow these steps on Windows to use Subversion (SVN) to access the Snap Backup source code and submit your changes.

== One-Time Environment Setup ==
*1) Download and Install JDK*
   Click the _&raquo; Download_ button for _JDK 6 Update X_ (where _X_ is the current update version) at:
      http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/
   Install the JDK with all the default options.

*2) Download and Install Apache Ant*
   Obtain the file _apache-ant-X.Y.Z-bin.zip_ (where _X.Y.Z_ is the current version, such as _1.7.1_):
      http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
  Unzip the file into _C:\Apps\Ant\_ so you have folder at: _C:\Apps\Ant\apache-ant-X.Y.Z_

*3) Download and Install SVN Client*
   Follow the *openCollabNet* link for Mac OS X at http://subversion.tigris.org/getting.html#binary-packages to get the installer (binary).

2) Get Your Password
   Visit http://code.google.com/hosting/settings to obtain your password

3) Download Code
   Run *Terminal* (it's in `/Applications/Utilities`) and enter the following commands at the Unix prompt:
   || `$ mk ~/Projects` ||
   || `$ cd ~/Projects` ||
   || `$ svn checkout https://snapbackup.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ snapbackup --username <USERNAME HERE>` ||
In the above instructions, replace "`<USERNAME HERE>`" with your Google Code username.

   || `$ svn update` ||
   || `$ svn status` ||
   || `$ svn commit --message "<COMMENT HERE>."` ||

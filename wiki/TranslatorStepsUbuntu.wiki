Follow these steps on Ubuntu to use Subversion (SVN) to access the appropriate Snap Backup properties file and submit your changes.

== 1. One-Time Environment and SVN Setup ==

   Run _Terminal_ (_Applications_ --> _Accessories_ --> _Terminal_) and enter the following commands at the Linux shell prompt:
   || `$ sudu apt-get install subversion` ||
   || `$ sudu apt-get install ant` ||

*B) Get Your Password*
   To obtain your password (needed for the next step), visit:
      http://code.google.com/hosting/settings

*C) Download Code*
   Back at the Linux shell prompt, enter the following commands:
   || `$ mkdir ~/Projects` ||
   || `$ cd ~/Projects` ||
   || `$ svn checkout https://snapbackup.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ snapbackup --username <USERNAME HERE>` ||
   In the above instructions, replace "`<USERNAME HERE>`" with your Google Code username.

== 2. Core Translator Steps ==
*A) Build Current Project and Verify*
   # Open _File Browser_ (_Places_ --> _Home Folder_)
   # Go to the folder `~/Projects/snapbackup/src/tools/`
   # Double-click and the file _*build.sh*_ and choose _Run in Terminal_
   # Go to the folder `~/Projects/snapbackup/build/`
   # Bring up the context menu (a.k.a. control-click menu, speed menu, or right-click menu) for _*snapbackup.jar*_ and choose the "Open with OpenJDK Java 6 Runtime" option
   # Verify that the Snap Backup application launches and works properly

*B) Edit Properties File*
   Use your editor to make changes to the appropriate properties file located in the `~/Projects/snapbackup/src/resources/properties/` folder.  Be sure to save the file with Unicode UTF-8 (no BOM) encoding.

*C) Build the Project and Verify*
   Repeat step A above.

*D) Check Changes into SVN Repository (Server)*
   Run _Terminal_ and enter the following commands at the Linux shell prompt:
   || `$ cd ~/Projects/snapbackup` ||
   || `$ svn update` ||
   || `$ svn status` ||
   || `$ svn commit --message "<COMMENT HERE>."` ||
   || `$ svn status` ||
   In the above instructions, replace "`<COMMENT HERE>`" with a short description of the changes you made.

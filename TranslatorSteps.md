# Translator Steps #

There are two ways to contribute your translation work to the Snap Backup project.

### A) E-Mail ###
Steps:
  1. Download the properties file from: [www.snapbackup.org/translate](http://www.snapbackup.org/translate/)
  1. Edit the properties file (save with UTF-8 encoding).
  1. E-mail the properties file to the Snap Backup Translators Mailing List at: [groups.google.com/group/snapbackup-translate](http://groups.google.com/group/snapbackup-translate)

This approach is simple, but there is no practical way to test your properties file before submitting it to the mailing list.  However, your properties file will be incorporated into the project, and an updated version of the Snap Backup application will be posted so you can test it.

### B) Direct Contribution ###
This approach involves setting up the Snap Backup project on your computer and submitting your properties file directly into the project repository hosted on Google Code.  Even if you are not a developer, this approach is actually pretty easy.

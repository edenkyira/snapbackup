=================================
See project wiki for full instructions:

1) Save installer from "Package Maker" to "/snapbackup/build"
2) Compress "SnapBackupInstaller.pkg"


Create Application Shell (one-time)
===================================
Follow these steps to convert the Executable Java Archive (JAR) file ("snapbackup.jar") into a Mac OS X application bundle shell ("Snap Backup.app").

1) Open Jar Bundler (it's in /Developer/Applications/Utilities installed by Xcode).
2) For "Main Class:", use the Choose... button to navigate to the ~/Projects/snapbackup/build folder and then Choose the snapbackup.jar file.
3) Check the "Use Macintosh Menu Bar" option.
4) Use the Choose Icon button to navigate to the ~/Projects/snapbackup/src/installer/mac folder and then Open the snap-backup.icns file.
5) Click the Properties tab and enter "{snap-backup-version}" into the fields "Version:" and "Get-Info String:".
6) Click the Create Application... button
7) Navigate to the ~/Projects/snapbackup/src/installer/mac/application-bundle folder
8) In the "File:" field, enter Snap Backup
9) Click the Create button
10) Quit Jar Bundler
11) In Finder, navigate to ~/Projects/snapbackup/src/installer/mac/application-bundle and do a "Show Package Contents" for Snap Backup ("Snap Backup.app")
12) Expand all the folders and delete the files "snapbackup.jar" and "snap-backup.icns" (the build process will later insert fresh versions)
13) Edit the "Info.plist" to add the following key/string just above the "MainClass" key:
	<key>SplashFile</key>
	<string>$JAVAROOT/splash.png</string>

The shell will be used by the build process to automatically create a Mac OS X application.

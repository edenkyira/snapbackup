<h1>Snap Backup User Guide</h1>

Snap Backup stores your important work with a single click.&nbsp;  This guide
   is intended to help individual computer users incorporate Snap Backup into
   their daily backup routine for a simple and convenient way to backup
   their valuable files.<br><br>

   </b></ul>
The "Best Practices" section covers backup philosophy, while the sections for
   "Getting Started", "Configuration Settings", "Advanced Configuration
   Settings", and "Export/Import Settings" cover the details of using Snap
   Backup.&nbsp;  The "100% Java" section covers platform independence and
   support for different languages.&nbsp;  The section about the "Command-Line
   Option" covers running Snap Backup without the GUI (Graphical User
   Interface).&nbsp;  And finally, the short "Upgrading" section is for
   installing a newer version of Snap Backup.<br><br>

<b>1) Best Practices</b><br>
How often do you backup?&nbsp;  How much work would you lose if your hard
   drive crashed right now?&nbsp;  People typically fail to backup their
   data frequently because of some combination of the following:<ul>
   <li>Users do not know which files to backup
   <li>If a procedure is in place, it is inconvenient or takes a long time
   <li>Resulting backup file is too big and cumbersome
   </ul>
Corporate system administrators have backup procedures for their company
   servers, databases, and network files.&nbsp;  Individual computer users,
   on the other hand, are usually left to fend for themselves.&nbsp;  The
   following strategies should help you create a backup procedure that is
   quick and easy:<ul><b>
   <li>Separate Data (work files) from Applications (program files)
   <li>Store All Data for Backup Under a Single High-Level Folder
   <li>Store Large Multimedia Files Separately (for less frequent backups)
   <li>Use Snap Backup to Save Your Data (work) Frequently
   </b></ul>
<i>Data vs. Applications</i><br>
You have probably at some time been advised to backup your entire hard
drive.&nbsp;  While this may be appropriate for some people, it is
impractical for most people.&nbsp;  Even if the process uses "delta"
technology, the resulting backup file is too huge to easily save and the
process often takes a painfully long time.&nbsp;  The reason for this
is that the vast majority of the files on your hard drive are operating
system files and application program files that do not need to be
backed up.&nbsp;  If one of your applications gets corrupted or
uninstalled, you can reinstall it from the install CD or Internet
download.&nbsp;  What you really need to backup are the data files that
store your work and configuration settings.&nbsp;  For
example, your word processor application might consume 100,000,000 bytes
of space on your hard drive, but all your word processor documents 
combined might only consume one hundredth that amount.&nbsp;  Your work
documents, not your applications, are critical to backup
regularly.&nbsp;  Your work is important to you, so you should know where
your data is located.&nbsp;  Facilitate quicker backups by separating your
data (work files) from your applications (program files).<br>
<br>
<i>Centralize Work Files</i><br>
Make your backups easier to configure by putting your data (work files)
into a single high-level folder, and name the folder something like
"My Work" or "Data".&nbsp;  Then when you backup your high-level data folder, you
have backed up all your work.<br>
<br>
<i>Handling Large Work Files</i><br>
Multimedia files, such as pictures and videos, present a special
challenge because they are important to backup, but their size makes them
cumbersome to backup frequently.&nbsp;  For multimedia files and other large
data files, create a folder called "Storage" or "Large Files" and put it
next to (not into) your high-level data folder.&nbsp;  While you backup your
high-level data daily, you might only backup your storage folder weekly or
monthly.<br>
<br>
<i>Make Backing Up Part of Your Daily Habit</i><br>
Once you have Snap Backup configured to backup your data (work files),
it is easy to backup your data daily.&nbsp;  Snap Backup automatically
puts the current date in the backup file name, alleviating you from the
tedious task of renaming your backup file for each backup.&nbsp;  Snap
Backup also optionally copies your backup file to an external archive
location.&nbsp;  The backup file is a single compressed file that can be read
by zip programs such as Unarchiver, gzip, 7-Zip, and Mac's built-in Archive
Utility in the event that you need to restore you data files.<br>
<br>

<b>2) Getting Started</b><br>
The first time you run Snap Backup, configure where your data files
   reside and where to save the backup files.&nbsp;  You can also
   specify an optional archive location, such as a USB drive, for
   storing copies of the backup files.&nbsp;  After saving your settings,
   they will be automatically available next time you run Snap Backup.&nbsp;
   Clicking the "Backup Now" button will start the backup process.&nbsp;
   Click the "Exit" button when the backup is finished.<br>
   Tip: <i>The "Backup Now" button is the default button when
   Snap Backup starts up, and it can be fired by just hitting the
   "Enter" key.&nbsp;  After the backup completes, "Exit" becomes the
   default button, so you can complete the entire backup process by
   launching Snap Backup and hitting "Enter" twice.</i><br>
<br>

<b>3) Configuration Settings</b><br>
Configure Snap Backup to work in your specific environment with the
settings described below.<br>
<br>
<i>Folder and Files to Backup</i><br>
   Use the "Add Folder or File" button to add a folder or file to the list of
   items to be backed up when you press the "Backup Button".&nbsp;  If you
   specify a folder, all its contents (sub-folders and files) will be included
   in the backup.&nbsp;  To delete a folder or file from the list, use the
   "Remove" button.<br>
   <br>
<i>Save Backup (Zip) File Into</i><br>
   Enter the full name of the folder into which you wish to have the backup file
   placed.&nbsp;  Enter the full name directly or use the button with the folder
   icon to browse for the desired folder.<br>
   <br>
<i>Backup Name</i><br>
   Enter the file name of the backup file to be created, but do not include
   the ".zip" extension, which is appended automatically, nor the folder path,
   which is specified in the "Save Backup (Zip) File Into" field.<br>
   <br>
<i>Copy Backup To</i><br>
   Use the checkbox to specify whether or not to make a copy of the backup
   file.&nbsp;  This feature is typically used to archive the backup file by
   coping it to a another location, like a USB flash drive (memory stick)
   or external hard drive.&nbsp;
   (Note: On Mac OS X, USB drives show up in the "Volumes" folder with the
   name given to the drive, such as "/Volumes/MyData".&nbsp;  On
   Windows, the USB Drive will show up under a drive letter, such as
   "F:\".)&nbsp;  Enter the full name of the folder into which you wish
   to have the backup file copied.<br>
   <br>
<i>Message Log</i><br>
   This area displays the names of the files add to the backup file and
   also displays any errors encountered while creating the backup.<br>
   <br>
<i>Save Settings</i><br>
   After you have configured Snap Backup with the desired settings,
   save them with the "Save Settings" button for automatic use next
   time you run Snap Backup.<br>
   <br>
<i>Restore Default Settings</i><br>
   Use the "Restore Default Settings" button to reset your
   configuration settings to the original generic settings.&nbsp;
   Note that your new settings will not be saved until you hit the
   "Save Settings" button.<br>
   <br>
<i>Backup Now</i><br>
   Use the "Backup Now" button to kick off the backup process.<br>
   <br>
<i>Exit</i><br>
   Use the "Exit" button to close Snap Backup after your backup
   is complete.<br>
   <br>

<b>4) Advanced Configuration Settings</b><br>
Some Snap Backup options need to be turned on from the "File" menu before
they can be used.<br>
<br>
<i>Backup Filters</i><br>
   Use the filters to gain more control over exactly which files to include
   in your backup.&nbsp;  Click the "Edit Filter" button to bring up
   to the filter editor and then create your rules.&nbsp;  For example,
   an include rule set to "bookmarks.html" will mean that only files named
   "bookmarks.html" will be backed up.  The star character ("*") is the
   wildcard, so an include rule of "*.txt, *.xml" means only files with
   either the ".txt" or ".xml" file extension will be backed up.&nbsp;  The
   exclude rule works in the opposite fashion.&nbsp;  An exclude rule of
   "*cache*" means that all files with the "cache" in any part of their
   name will be skipped over and not included in the backup.&nbsp;  The
   exclude rule takes precedence over the include rule.<br>
   <br>
<i>Multiple Backup Profiles</i><br>
   If you have sets of files you want to backup separately, such as work
   files and personal files, then navigate to the "Multiple Profiles" option
   on the "File" menu and select "On".&nbsp;  A "Backup Profiles" section
   will appear on the left side the Snap Backup window.&nbsp;  Use the "New"
   button to create profiles with different backup settings.<br>
   <br>
<i>Look & Feel</i><br>
   Use the "Look & Feel" options under the "File" menu to select a style
   best for your tastes.<br>
   <br>

<b>5) Export/Import Settings</b><br>
Once you have your configuration settings properly setup, you should back them
   up so the settings can be restored if needed.&nbsp;  Choose "Export
   Settings..." from the "File" menu to save your settings to a file.&nbsp;
   If you need to restore your previously saved settings, choose the "Import
   Settings..." also in the "File" menu.<br><br>
Note that settings relative to your home folder are restored using your
   home folder at the time of import.&nbsp;  For example, if your user name is
   "michelle", you might configure Snap Backup to zip up the folder
   "/Users/michelle/Documents".&nbsp;  If you export your settings and then
   import them on a system where your user name is "mjohnson", Snap Backup will
   adjust your settings to zip up the folder "/Users/mjohnson/Documents".<br><br>

<b>6) 100% Java</b><br>
Snap Backup is 100% Java and designed to run on any computer with
   Java 5 (JRE 1.5) or greater.&nbsp;  Snap Backup is fully
   internationalized.&nbsp;  Visit the Snap Backup web site
   (http://www.snapbackup.com) for information about different international
   languages supported.<br><br>
Your feedback is important for improving Snap Backup.&nbsp;  Please submit
   suggestions and bug reports using the on-line form at
   "http://www.snapbackup.com/feedback".&nbsp;  When submitting bug reports,
   include the "System Information" found in the About Box (Help | About
   Snap Backup).<br><br>

<b>7) Command-Line Option</b><br>
To facilitate launching backups from scripts and schedulers, Snap Backup can be
run from the command-line.&nbsp;  The form of the command is:<br><br>
   <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
   $ java -jar snapbackup.jar &lt;profile_name&gt;
   </code><br><br>
Replace "&lt;profile_name&gt;" with the name of the backup profile you wish to
use.&nbsp;  For example, the following command would be used to perform a
backup with the settings for the "Spreadsheets" profile:<br><br>
   <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
   $ java -jar snapbackup.jar spreadsheets
   </code><br><br>
The profile name is case-insensitive.&nbsp;  If the profile name contains a
space, be sure to enclose the name in quotes.<br><br>
Specify "~" for the profile name if you only have one profile or just want to
use whatever profile is the current default profile.&nbsp;  The command
is:<br><br>
   <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
   $ java -jar snapbackup.jar ~
   </code><br><br>
Depending on how your computer is setup and where you have Snap Backup
installed, you may need to specify the full path for "java" or
"snapbackup.jar" or both.&nbsp;  On most Windows systems, for example, you
would use a command like:<br><br>
   <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
   &gt; java -jar "C:\Program Files\Center Key Software\Snap Backup\snapbackup.jar" ~
   </code><br><br>
To schedule your backups on Windows to be performed automatically, create a one
line file called "Snap Backup.cmd" containing the Snap Backup command.&nbsp;
Then go into the "Control Panel" and open "Scheduled Tasks".&nbsp;  From there,
use "Add Scheduled Task" to "Browse..." to the "Snap Backup.cmd" file and
schedule your backups.<br><br>

<b>8) Upgrading</b><br>
To upgrade your version of Snap Backup, simply install the new
version.&nbsp;  The new version will cleanly replace the old version, and all
your backup settings will automatically be preserved.<br><br>

<b>9) Known Issues</b><ui>
<li><b>Backup the Backup File Lock:</b> Putting the backup file into a
   folder designated to be backed up will cause a lock up (as the backup
   file will contain itself).
<li><b>Empty Zip File on Windows XP:</b> A bug in Windows XP Compressed
   Folder causes some zip files to show up empty even though they are
   not.&nbsp;  Use a different compression utility, like 7-Zip, to
   workaround this XP bug.
